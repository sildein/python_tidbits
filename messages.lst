$python2_msg
You are using a Python 2 interpreter, which is deprecated software. This script
hasn't been tested for backwards-compatibility.

If you absolutely need to use outdated software (even WinXP has a Python 3
interpreter), you can choose to ignore this on a per-program basis by setting
'py2_gtfo' to False in the script's config section. Keep in mind that
this may result in crashes or unexpected (and potentially bad) behavior, and it
will be entirely your fault.
$end

$unix_os_msg
This script has a superior, native Unix equivalent, and it's recommended that
you use it instead. Override this by editing the script's config section and
setting 'unix_check' to False.

$mkrandom_help
mkrandom.py creates files of a given size with random data.

Usage:

    [python] mkrandom.py file [size=(int)] [iter=(int)] [verbose]

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    size    | Length of the file in bytes (default = 1MB)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    iter    | Create this many files in a loop, appending the filenames with an
            | integer (default = 1)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    quiet   | Don't announce file creations on the console (may help a little
            | with large loops on SSDs)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
$end

$archive_all_help
archive_all.py is a backup script that creates individual 7z archives for each
file or directory within the input directory. Obviously, this requires the
console version of 7zip to be installed and in your PATH.

Usage:

    [python] archive_all.py [wd=(str)] [ignore=(str)] [verbose]

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    id     | Input directory. The one that contains what we want to archive.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    od     | Output directory. Where we want the archives to go.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    blist  | Blacklist. A text file containing a line-separated list of files
           | or directories to ignore.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    wlist  | Whitelist. A text file containing a line-separated list of files
           | or directories you *specifically* want to archive.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If neither 'id' or 'od' are set, a folder named 'Trash' will be created in the
PWD (if it doesn't already exist), and things that are successfully archived
will be moved here afterwards.

The 'wlist' and 'blist' arguments cannot be used together.
$end

$archive_all_list_error
You cannot use both a whitelist and blacklist in the same command.
$end

$tree_help
tree.py recursively drills through the folder hierarchy under a given root
and prints the paths and filenames of any files found.

Usage:

    [python] tree.py root [abs] [rel]

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    root    | Root folder. The base of the directory tree.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    abs     | Print absolute paths to discovered files.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    rel     | Print relative paths to discovered files.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If neither 'abs' or 'rel' are specified, then relative paths will be used for
the current (.) or parent (..) entries, and absolute paths for anything else.
Obviously, these arguments conflict.
$end

$touch_help
touch.py literally just creates empty files.

Usage:

    [python] touch.py file

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    file    | The file to be created.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's literally it.
$end
